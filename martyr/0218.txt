He was consecrated bishop of Jerusalem after St. James, the brother of our Lord, and in the persecution of Trajan, after having endured many torments, he consummated his martyrdom. All who were present, even the judge himself, were astonished that a man one hundred and twenty years of age could bear the torment of crucifixion with such fortitude and constancy.&mdash;At Ostia, the holy martyrs Maximus and his brother Claudius, and Praepedigna, the wife of Claudius, with her two sons Alexander   and Cutias, all of an illustrious family.

Their remains were cast into the river, but the Christians found them and buried them near that city.&mdash;In Africa, the holy martyrs Lucius, Sylvanus, Rutulus, Classicus, Secundinus, Fructulus, and Maximus.&mdash;At Constantinople, the holy bishop Flavian, who for having defended the Catholic faith at Ephesus, was buffeted and kicked by the partisans of the impious Dioscorus, and being banished, ended his life within three days.&mdash;At Toledo, St. Helladius, bishop and confessor.

AT Pergen, in Pamphylia, during the persecution
of Decius, the birthday of the blessed bishop Nestor, who, praying night and day for the preservation
of the flock of Christ, was put under arrest. As he
confessed the name of the Lord with great joy and
freedom, he was most cruelly tortured on the rack,
by order of the governor Pollio, and still courageously proclaiming that he would ever remain faithful to Christ, he was suspended on a cross; and thus
triumphantly went to heaven.&mdash;In the same place,
the passion of Saints Papias, Diodorus, Conon, and
Claudian, who preceded St. Nestor to martyrdom.&mdash;
Also, the holy martyrs Fortunatus, Felix, and
twenty-seven others.&mdash;At Alexandria, the bishop St.
Alexander, an aged man held in great honor, who
succeeded blessed Peter as bishop of that city. He
expelled from the Church Arius, one of his priests,
tainted with heretical impiety, and convicted by
divine truth, and subsequently was one of the three
hundred and eighteen Fathers who condemned him
in the Council of Nicaea.&mdash;At Bologna, the bishop St.
Faustinian, whose preaching strengthened and mu]tiplied the faithful of that Church, which had been
much afflicted during the persecution of Diocletian.

Arcadius, St. Porphyry, bishop, who overthrew the
idol Marnas and its temple, and after many sufferings, went to rest in the Lord.&mdash;At Florence. St.

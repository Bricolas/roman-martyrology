AT Rome, on the Ardeatine road, the holy martyrs
Nereus and Achilleus, brothers, who first underwent a long exile for Christ in the island of Pontia
with Flavia Domitilla, whose chamberlains they
were. Afterwards they endured a most severe
scourging. Finally, as the ex-consul Minutius Rufus endeavored by using the rack and fire to force
them to offer sacrifices, they said, that having been
baptized by the blessed Apostle Peter, they could by
no means sacrifice to idols. They were beheaded,
and their sacred relics, with those of Flavia Domitilla, were, by order of pope Clement VIII., solemnly
transferred the day before this, from the sacristy of
St. Adrian to their ancient church now repaired, in
which they were formerly preserved.&mdash;In the same
place, on the Aurelian road, the holy martyr Pancratius, who, at fourteen years of age, endured martyrdom by decapitation under Diocletian.&mdash;Also, at
Rome, St. Denis, uncle of the same blessed Pancratius.&mdash;In Sicily, St. Philip Argyrio, who was sent to
that island by the Roman Pontitf, and converted to
Christ a great portion of it. His sanctity is particularly manifested by the deliverance of possessed
persons.&mdash;At Salamis, in Cyprus, St. Epiphanius, a
bishop of great erudition and profound knowledge
of the holy Scriptures. He was also admirable for
the sanctity of his life, his zeal for the Catholic faith,
his charity to the poor, and the gift of miracles.&mdash;
At Constantinople, St. Germanus, a bishop distinguished by virtues and learning, who with great
courage reprehended Leo the Isaurian for promulgating an edict against holy images.&mdash;At Treves,
St. Modoaldus, bishop.&mdash;At Calzada, St. Dominic,
confessor.

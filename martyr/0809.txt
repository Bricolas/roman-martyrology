torments of blessed Lawrence to ask for baptism
from him. He was immediately prosecuted,
scourged, and finally beheaded.&mdash;In Tuscany, the
birthday of the holy martyrs Secundian, Marcellian, and Verian. In the time of Decius, they were
scourged by the ex-consul Promotus, then racked
and torn with iron hooks. Being burned with fire
applied to their sides, they merited the triumphant
palm of martyrdom by having their heads struck
off.&mdash;At Verona, the holy martyrs Firmus and Rusticus, in the time of the emperor Maximian.&mdash;In
Africa, the commemoration of many holy martyrs,
during the persecution of Valerian. Being exhorted
by St. Numidicus, they obtained the palm of martyrdom by being cast into the fire, but Numidicus,
although thrown into the flames with the others and
overwhelmed with stones, was nevertheless taken
out by his daughter. Found half dead, he was restored and deserved afterwards by his virtue to be
made priest of the church of Carthage by blessed
Cyprian.&mdash;At Constantinople, the holy martyrs
Julian, Marcian, and eight others. For having set
up the image of our Saviour on the brazen gate,
they were exposed to many torments, and then beheaded by order of the impious emperor Leo.&mdash;At

Mount Carmel, the holy prophet Elias.&mdash;The same
day, the birthday of blessed Joseph, surnamed the
Just, whom the Apostles selected with blessed Matthias for the apostleship, in the place of the traitor
Judas. The lot having fallen upon Matthias, Joseph, notwithstanding, continued to preach and to
advance in virtue, and after having sustained from
the Jews many persecutions for the faith of Christ,
happily ended his life in Judea. It is related of him

from it, because of his confidence in the Lord.&mdash;At
Damascus, the holy martyrs Sabinus, Julian, Maximus, Macrobius, Cassia, and Paula, with ten others.

put to death, and went to his reward in heaven.&mdash;In
Portugal, St. Wilgefortes, virgin and martyr, who
merited the crown of martyrdom on a cross in defence of the faith and her chastity.&mdash;At Boulogne,
in France, the abbot St. Wulmar, a man of admirable
sanctity.&mdash;At Treves, St. Severa, virgin.

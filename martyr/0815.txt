THE Assumption of the most holy Virgin Mary,
Mother of God.&mdash;At Rome, on the Appian
Way, St. Tharsicius, acolyte. The Pagans accosted
him as he was carrying the sacrament of Christ's
body, and began to inquire what it was. But
he judged it an unworthy thing to cast pearls be'fore swine. They therefore beat him with sticks
and stones until he expired. The sacrilegious
searchers examined his body, but found no vestige
of the sacrament of Christ, either in his hands or
in his clothes. The Christians took up the body of
the martyr, and buried it reverently in the cemetery
of Callistus.&mdash;At Tagasta, in Africa, St. Alipius,
bishop, who was the disciple of blessed Augustine,
and the companion of his conversion, his colleague
in the pastoral charge, his valiant fellow-soldier in
combating heretics, and finally his partner in the
glory of heaven.&mdash;At Soissons, in France, St. Arnulf,
bishop and confessor.&mdash;At Alba, in Hungary, St.
Stephen, king of the Hungarians, whose feast is celebrated on the 2d of September.&mdash;At Rome, St.
Stanislaus Kostka, a native of Poland, confessor, of
the Society of Jesus, who being made perfect in a
short space, fulfilled a long time by the angelica]
innocence of his life. He was inscribed on the list
of the saints by the Sovereign Pontiff,Benedict XIII.

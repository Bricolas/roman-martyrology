AT Alexandria, the birthday of blessed Mark,
evangelist, disciple and interpreter of the apostle
St. Peter. He wrote his gospel at the request of the
faithful of Rome, and taking it with him, proceeded
to Egypt and founded a church at Alexandria, where
he was the first to announce Christ. Afterwards,
being arrested for the faith, he was bound, dragged
over stones and endured great afflictions. Finally
he was confined to prison, where, being comforted
by the visit of an angel, and even by an apparition
of our Lord himself, he was called to the heavenly
kingdom in the eighth year of the reign of Nero.&mdash;

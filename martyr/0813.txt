AT Rome, blessed Hippolytus, martyr, who gloriously confessed the faith, under the emperor Valerian
After enduring other torments, he was tied by the
feet to the necks of wild horses, and being cruelly
dragged through briars and brambles, and having all
his body lacerated, he yielded up his spirit. On the
same day, suffered also blessed Concordia, his nurse,
who being scourged in his presence with leaded
whips, went to our Lord; and nineteen others of his
house, who were beheaded beyond the Tiburtine gate,
and buried with him in the Veran field.&mdash;At Imola,
the birthday of St. Cassian, martyr. As he refused
to worship idols, the persecutor called the boys
whom the saint taught and who hated him, giving
them leave to kill him. The torment suffered by the
martyr was the more grievous, as the hand which
inflicted it, by reason of its weakness, rendered
death more tardy.&mdash;At Todi, St. Cassian, bishop and
martyr, under the emperor Diocletian.&mdash;At Burgos,
in Spain, the Saints Centolla and Helena, martyrs.
&mdash;At Constantinople, St. Maximus, a monk, distinguished for learning and for zeal for Catholic
truth. Combating valiantly the Monothelites, he
had his hands and tongue torn from him by the
heretical emperor Constans, and was banished to
Chersonesus, where he breathed his last. At this
time, two of his disciples, both called Anastasius,
and many others endured diverse torments and the
hardhips of exile.&mdash;In Germany, St. Wigbert, priest
and. confessor.&mdash;At Rome, St. John Berchmans, a
scholastic of the Society of Jesus, illustrious for his
innocence and for his fidelity to the rules of the religious life. He was canonized by Leo XIII.&mdash;At

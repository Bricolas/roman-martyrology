dtbe «Eleventh Day of Slum.

THE birthday of the apostle St. Barnabas, born in.

Cyprus. By the disciples, he was ordained apos-

tle of the Gentiles With St. Paul, and With him trav-
ersed many regions, fulﬁlling his commission to
preach the Gospel. At length he went to Cyprus,
Where he ennobled his apostolate by a glorious mar-
tyrdom. Through his own revelation his body was
found, in the time of the emperor Zeno, together
with a copy of St. MattheW’s gospel copied with his
own hand.—At Aquileia, the martyrdom of the
saints Feilx and Fortunatus, brothers. In the per-
secution of Diocletian and Maximian, they Were
racked, and had ﬂaming torches held against their
sides. These being extinguished by the power of
God, boiling oil was poured over them, and as they
persevered in confessing Christ, they were decapi-
tated.—At Bologna, St. Parisius, confessor, a monk
of the Order of Camaldo1i.—At Rome, the transla-
tion of St. Gregory Nazianzen, Whose sacerd body
after having been brought from Constantinople to
Rome, and kept a long time in the church of the
Mother of God, Was, by the Sovereign Pontilf, Greg-
ory XIII., transferred with great solemnity to a
chapel of the basilica of St. Peter, most sumptu-
ously decorated by his Holiness, and the next day
placed with due honor beneath the altar.

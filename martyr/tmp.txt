AT Antioch, the birthday of the martyr St. Phocas,

who triumphed over the old serpent after many
injuries which he suffered for the name of the Re-
deemer. That triumph is still manifested to the
people in our days; for if any one stung by a serpent,
touches with faith the door of the martyr’s basilica,
the power of the venom disappears, and he is imme-
diately cured.—At Caesarea, in Palestine, in the per-
secution of Diocletian, St. Adrian, martyr, who,
being ﬁrst exposed‘ to a lion for the faith of Christ
and then killed with the sword by order of the gov-
ernor Firmilian, received the crown of martyrdom.——
The same day, the passion of the holy martyrs Ense-
bius, officer of the imperial palace, and nine others.—
At Caesarea, in Palestine, in the time of the emperor
Severus, St. Theophilus, bishop, who was conspicu-
ous by his wisdom and the purity of his 1ife.—Also
in Palestine, on the banks of the Jordan, the an-
choret St. Gerasimus, who lived in the time of the
emperor Zeno.—At Naples, the decease of St. John
Joseph of the Cross, Promoter and ﬁrst Provincial
of the Italian branch of the Order of Discalced
Minorites of St. Peter of Alcantara, who, by emulat-
ing the virtues of St. Francis of Assisi and St. Peter

of Alcantara, became a new ornament of the Sera- -

phic Order. He was canonized by pope Gregory
XVI.

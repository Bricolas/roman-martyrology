der Dioc1etian.—At Sebaste, St. Antiochus, a physi-
cian, who was decapitated under the governor Ad-
rian. On seeing milk ﬂowing from his Wounds in-
stead of blood, Cyriacus, his executioner, was con-
verted to Christ and endured martyrdom.—At
Pavia, St. Felix, bishop and martyr.—At Nisibis,
the birthday of St. James, bishop of that city, a man
celebrated fo-r great holiness, miracles and erudi-
tion. He was one of those who confessed the faith
during the persecution of Galerius Maximian, and
afterwards, in the Council of Nicaea, condemned the
perverse heresy of Arius, by opposing to it the doc-
trine of consubstantiality. It was also owing to his
prayers, and those of bishop Alexander, that Arius
received at Constantinople the condign punishment
of his iniquity, the extravasation of his intestines.-
At Naples, in Campania, St. Athana.sius, bishop of
that city, who suﬂered much from his wicked nephew
Sergius, by Whom he was driven from his see. Con-
sumed with aﬂiictions, he departed for heaven at
Veroli, in the time of Charles the Ba1d.—At Paler-
mo, the ﬁnding of the body of St. Rosalia, virgin of
Palermo. Being miraculously discovered in the time
of .the Sovereign Pontiﬁ, Urban VIII., it delivered
Sicily from the plague in the year of the Jubilee.

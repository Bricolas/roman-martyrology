T. FRANCIS of Paula, founder of the Order of
Minims. As he was renowned for virtues and
miracles, he was .inscribed among the Saints by
Leo X.—At Caesarea, in Palestine, during the per-
secution of Galerius Maximian, the birthday of the
martyr St. Amphian, who, because he reproved the
governor Urban for sacriﬁcing to idols, was cruelly
lacerated and, with his feet wrapped in a cloth sat-
urated with oil, was set on ﬁre. After these painful
tortures, he was plunged into the sea. Thus
through ﬁre and water, he reached everlasting re-
pose.—In the same city, the passion of St. Theodo-
sia, a virgin of Tyre, who, in the same persecution,
for having publicly saluted the holy confessors as
they stood before the tribunal, and begged of them
to remember her when they should be with God, was
arrested and led to the governor Urban. By his
order, her sides and breasts were lacerated to the
very vitals, and she was thrown into the sea.—At
Lyons, St. Nizier, bishop of that city, renowned for
his saintly life and miracles.—At Como, St. Abun-
dius, bishop and confessor.—At Langres, St. Urban,
bishop.—In Palestine, the decease of St. Mary of
Egypt, surnamed the Sinner.

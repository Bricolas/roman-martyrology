Successus, Martial, Urbanus, Julia, Quinc tilian, Pub-
ilus, Fronto, Felix, Gmcilian, Eventius, Primitivus,
Apodemius, and four others, who, it is said, bore the
name of Saturninus. — Under Dacian, governor of
Spain, they were all together subjected to torments
and slain. The glory of their martyrdom has been
celebrated in verse by Prudentius.—In the same
place, St. Encratis, a virgin and martyr who had
her body lacerated, her breasts cut off, and her liver
plucked out. As she survived these torments, she
was conﬁned in a prison until her ulcerated ﬂesh
putreﬁed.—In the same city, the Saints Caius and
Crementius, who twice confessed the faith of Christ,
and persevering in it, drank of the chalice of mar-
tyrdom.—Again in the same place, the martyr St.
Lambert.—At Palencia, St. Turibius, bishop of As-
torga, who with the aid of pope St. Leo, drove the
heresy of Priscillian entirely out of Spain, and went
to rest in the Lord with a great renown for miracles.
—At Braga, in Portugal, the bishop St. Fructuo-
sus.—The same day, St. Paternus, bishop of Av-
ranches.—In Belgium, near Valenciennes, St. Drogo,
c_onfessor.—At Siena, in Tuscany, blessed Joachim,
of the Order of the Servites of the Blessed Virgin
Mary.—-At Rome, the birthday of St. Benedict Jo-
seph Labre, confessor, who was renowned for his
contempt of self and his great voluntary poverty.

ST. JAMES the Apostle, brother of the blessed
evangelist John, who was beheaded by Herod
Agrippa about the feast of Easter. His sacred
bones were on this day carried from Jerusaelm to
Spain, and placed in the remote province of Galicia,
where they are devoutly honored by the far-famed
piety of the inhabitants, and the frequent concourse
of Christians, who visit them through piety and in
fulfilment of their vows.&mdash;In Lycia, in the time of
Decius, St. Christopher, martyr. Being scourged
with iron rods, cast into the flames, from which he
was saved by the power of Christ, and finally transfixed with arrows and beheaded, he completed his
martyrdom.&mdash;At Barcelona, in Spain, during the
persecution of Diocletian and under the governor
Dacian, the birthday of the holy martyr Cucuphas.
After overcoming many torments, he was struck
with the sword, and thus went triumphantly to
heaven.&mdash;In Palestine, St. Paul, a martyr, in the
persecution of Maximian Galerius, and under the
governor Firmilian. He was condemned to capital
punishment, but having obtained a short respite to
pray, he besought God with all his heart, first for his
own countrymen, then for the Jews and the Gentiles,
that they might embrace the true faith, next for the
multitude of the spectators, and finally for the judge
who had condemned him and the executioner that
was to strike him; after which he received the crown
of martyrdom by being beheaded.&mdash;In the same
country, St. Valentina, a virgin, who was led to an
altar to oifer sacrifice, but overturning it with her

fire with another virgin, her companion, she went to

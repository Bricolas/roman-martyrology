AT Alexandria, the holy martyrs Heron, Arsenius, 
Isidore and Dioscorus, a boy. In the persecution of Decius, the first three were subjected to all 
the refinements of cruelty by the judge, who, seeing 
them displaying the same constancy, ordered that 
they should be cast into the fire. But Dioscorus, 
after repeated scourgings, was set free through the 
intervention of Providence for the consolation of 
the faithful.&mdash;At Antioch, the birthday of the holy 
martyrs Drusus, Zosimus and Theodore.&mdash;The same 
day, the martyrdom of the Saints Justus and Abundius, who were cast into the flames in the time of the 
emperor Numerian and the governor Olybrius; but 
having escaped uninjured, they were struck with the 
sword.&mdash;At Rheims, the holy bishop Nicasius, his 
sister, the virgin Eutropia, and their companions, 
martyrs, who were put to death by barbarians hostile 
to the Church.&mdash;In the island of Cyprus, the birthday 
of blessed Spiridion, bishop. He was one of those 
confessors who were condemned to labor in the mines, 
after the plucking out of their right eye and the 
severing of the sinews of the left knee. This prelate 
was renowned for the gift of prophecy and glorious 
miracles, and in the council of Nicaea he confounded 
a heathen philosopher who insulted the Christian 
religion and brought him to the faith.&mdash;At Bergamo, 
St. Viator, bishop and confessor.&mdash;At Pavia, St. 
Pompey, bishop.&mdash;At Naples, in Campania, St. Agnellus, abbot. Illustrious by the gift of miracles, he 
was often seen with the standard of the cross delivering the city besieged by enemies.&mdash;At Ubeda, in 
Spain, St. John of the Cross, confessor, companion 
of St. Theresa in reforming the Carmelites. His 
feast is kept on the 24th of November.&mdash;At Milan, St. 
Matronian, hermit.

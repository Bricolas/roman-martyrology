and heretics, he was finally, in the persecution of 
Decius, crowned with a martyrdom which fills the 
mind with admiration, according to the words of 
pope St. Cornelius.&mdash;At Antioch, St. Erasmus, martyr.&mdash;At Caesarea, in Cappadocia, St. Mercury, soldier, who vanquished the barbarians and triumphed

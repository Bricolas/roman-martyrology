AT Rome, on the Aurelian road, the birthday of 
blessed Callistus, pope and martyr. By order 
of the emperor Alexander, after being a long time 
kept in prison without food, and daily scourged 
with rods, he was finally hurled from the window 
of the house in which he had been shut up, and cast 
into a well, and thus merited the triumph awarded 
to conquerors.&mdash;At Caesarea, in Palestine, St. Fortunata, virgin and martyr, during the persecution of

conveyed to Naples, in Campania.&mdash;Also, the Saints 
Carponius, Evaristus, and Priscian, brothers of the 
said blessed Fortunata, who having their throats 
cut, obtained likewise the crown of martyrdom. 
&mdash;Also, the Saints Saturninus and Lupus.&mdash;At Rimini, 
St. Gaudentius, bishop and martyr.&mdash;At Todi, St.

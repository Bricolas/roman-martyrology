AT Paris, St. Louis, confessor, king of France, 
illustrious by the holiness of his life and the 
fame of his miracles.&mdash;At Rome, in the time of the 
emperor Commodus, the holy martyrs Eusebius, 
Pontian, Vincent, and Peregrinus, who were first 
racked, distended by ropes, then beaten with rods 
and burned on their sides. As they continued 
faithfully to praise Christ, they were scourged with 
leaded whips until they expired.&mdash;Also, at Rome, 
St. Genesius, martyr, who embraced the profession 
of actor while he was yet a Pagan. One day he 
was deriding the Christian mysteries in the theatre 
in the presence of the emperor Diocletian; but by 
the inspiration of God he was suddenly converted 
to the faith and baptized. By the command of the 
emperor, he was forthwith most cruelly beaten with 
rods, then racked, and a long time lacerated with 
iron hooks, and burned with fire-brands. As he 
remained firm in the faith of Christ, and said: 
"There is no king besides Christ. Should you kill 
me a thousand times, you shall not be able to take 
Him from my lips or my heart," he was beheaded, 
and thus merited the palm of martyrdom.&mdash;At Italica, in Spain, St. Gerontius, a bishop, who preached 
the Gospel in that country in apostolic times, and 
after many labors died in prison.&mdash;At Aries, in 
France, another blessed Genesius, who, filling the 
office of notary, and refusing to record the impious 
edicts by which Christians were commanded to be 
punished, threw away his tablets publicly, and declared himself a Christian. He was seized and beheaded, and thus attained to the glory of martyrdom 
through baptism in his blood.&mdash;In Syria, St. Julian, 
martyr.&mdash;At Tarragona, St. Maginus, martyr.&mdash;At 
Constantinople, St. Mennas, bishop.&mdash;At Utrecht, St. 
Gregory, bishop.&mdash;At Naples, St. Patricia, virgin.

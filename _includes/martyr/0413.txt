AT Seville, in Spain, St. Hermenegild, son of Leovigild, Arian king of the Visigoths, who was incarcerated for the confession of the Catholic faith.
By order of his wicked father he was beheaded because he had refused to receive communion from an
Arian bishop, on the Paschal solemnity, and thus
exchanging an earthly for a heavenly kingdom, he
entered the abode of the blessed, both as a king and
as a martyr.&mdash;At Pergamus, in Asia, the birthday
of the holy martyrs Carpus, bishop of Thyatira,
Papylus, deacon, and his sister Agathonica, an excellent woman, Agathadorus, their servant, and many
others, who after various torments, were, for their
blessed confession, crowned with martyrdom in the
persecution of Marcus Antoninus Verus and Lucius
Aurelius Commodus.&mdash;In this same persecution,
there suffered at Rome that remarkable man, Justin
the Philosopher, who had addressed to the emperors
his second Apology in defence of our religion, and
upheld it by strong arguments. Being accused of
professing Chirstianity by the intrigues of the Cynic
Crescens, whose conduct and immorality he had reproved, he obtained the reward of a martyr, as a
remuneration for his faithful confession.&mdash;The same
day, the martyrdom of the Saints Maximus, Quinctillian, and Dadas, during the persecution of Diocletian.&mdash;At Ravenna, St. Ursus, bishop and confessor.

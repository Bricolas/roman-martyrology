AT Rome, the holy martyrs Evagrius, Priscian, and 
their companions.&mdash;At Ravenna, on the Lauretine 
road, the birthday of St. Edistius, martyr.&mdash;In Lycia, 
St. Domnina, martyr, under the emperor Diocletian. 
&mdash;In Africa, four thousand nine hundred and sixty-six holy confessors and martyrs, in the persecution of 
the Vandals under the Arian king Hunneric. Some 
of them were bishops, some priests and deacons, with 
a multitude of the faithful accompanying them, who 
were driven into a frightful wilderness for the defence of the Catholic truth. Many of them were 
cruelly annoyed by the Moorish leaders, and with 
sharp-pointed spears and stones forced to hasten 
their march, whilst others, with their feet tied, were 
dragged like corpses through rough places and mangled in all their limbs. They were finally tortured 
in different manners, and won the honors of martyrdom. The principal among them were the bishops 
Felix and Cyprian.&mdash;At Cilly, in Styria, St. Maximilian, bishop of Lorch.&mdash;At York, in England, St. 
Wilfrid, bishop and confessor,&mdash;At Milan, St. Monas, 
bishop. He was chosen as head of that church, because a miraculous light from heaven surrounded 
him whilst they were deliberating on the choice of a 
bishop.&mdash;At Verona, St. Salvinus, bishop.&mdash;In 
Syria, St. Eustachius, priest and confessor.&mdash;At 
Ascoli, St. Seraphinus, confessor, of the Order of 
Minorite Capuchins, distinguished by holiness of 
life and humility. He was enrolled among the 
saints by the Sovereign Pontiff, Clement XIII.

AT Rome, the birthday of the holy martyr Marcellinus, priest, and Peter, exorcist, who instructed
in the faith many persons detained in prison. Under Diocletian, they were loaded with chains, and,
after enduring many torments, were beheaded by the
judge Serenus, in a place which was then called the
Black Forest, but which was in their honor afterwards known as the White Forest. Their bodies
were buried in a crypt near St. Tiburtius, and pope
St. Damasus composed for their tomb an epitaph in
verse.&mdash;In Campania, during the reign of Decius, St.
Erasmus, bishop and martyr, who was first scourged
with leaded whips and then severely beaten with
rods; he had also rosin, brimstone, lead, pitch, wax,
and oil poured over him, without receiving any injury. Afterwards, under Maximian, he was again
subjected to various most horrible tortures at Mola,
but was still preserved from death by the power of
God for the strengthening of others in the faith.
Finally, celebrated for his sufferings, and called by
God, he closed his life by a peaceful and holy end.
His body was afterwards transferred to Gaeta.&mdash;At
Lyons, many holy martyrs (Photinus, bishop, Sanctus, deacon, Vetius, Epagathus, Maturus, Ponticus,
Biblis, Attalus, Alexander and Blandina, with many
others), whose many valiant combats, in the time
of Marcus Aurelius Antoninus and Lucius Verus,
are recorded in a letter from the church at Lyons to
the churches of Asia and Phrygia. St. Blandina,
one of these martyrs, though weaker on account of
her sex and frame, and of her lower condition in
life, encountered longer and more terrible trials.
But remaining unshaken, she was put to the sword,
and followed those whom she had exhorted to win
the palm of martyrdom.&mdash;At Rome, St. Eugenius,
pope and confessor.&mdash;At Tarni, in Terra-di-Bari, St.
Nicholas Peregrinus, confessor, whose miracles were
related in the Roman Council, under Urban II.

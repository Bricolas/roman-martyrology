THE feast of our Lady of Ransom.&mdash;At Autun, 
the birthday of the holy martyrs, Andochius, 
priest, Thyrsus, deacon, and Felix, who were sent 
from the East by blessed Polycarp, bishop of Smyrna, to preach in Gaul, where they were most severely 
scourged, hanged up a whole day by the hands, and 
cast into the fire. Remaining uninjured, they had 
their necks broken with heavy bars, and thus won a 
most glorious crown.&mdash;In Egypt, the holy martyrs 
Paphnutius and his companions. Whilst leading a 
solitary life, St. Paphnutius heard that many Christians were kept in bonds, and, moved by the spirit of 
God, he voluntarily offered himself to the prefect, 
and freely confessed the Christian faith. By him he 
was bound with iron chains, and a long time tortured 
on the rack. Then, being sent with many others to 
Diocletian, he was fastened by his order to a palm 
tree, and the rest were struck with the sword.&mdash;At 
Chalcedon, forty-nine holy martyrs, who, after the 
martyrdom of St. Euphemia, under the emperor Diocletian, were condemned to be devoured by the beasts, 
but being miraculously delivered, were finally struck 
with the sword, and went to heaven.&mdash;In Hungary, 
St. Gerard, bishop and martyr, called the Apostle of 
the Hungarians. He belonged to the nobility of 
Venice, and was the first to shed upon his country 
the glory of martyrdom.&mdash;At Clermont, in Auvergne, 
the departure out of this life of St. Rusticus, bishop 
and confessor.&mdash;In the diocese of Beauvais, St. Geremarus, abbot.

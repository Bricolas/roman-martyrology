THE feast of the Most Holy Rosary of the Blessed 
Virgin Mary, and the commemoration of Our 
Lady of Victory, which the sovereign Pontiff, blessed 
Pius V., on account of the great naval victory gained 
by the Christians on this day, ordered to be kept 
annually.&mdash;At Rome, on the Ardeatine road, the demise of St. Mark, pope and confessor.&mdash;In the province of the Euphrates, the holy martyrs Sergius and 
Bacchus, noble Romans, in the time of the emperor 
Maximian. Bacchus, being scourged with rough 
whips until his body was completely mangled, 
breathed his last in the confession of Christ. Sergius 
had his feet forced into shoes full of sharp-pointed 
nails, and, remaining unshaken in the faith, he was 
sentenced to undergo capital punishment. The 
place where he reposes is called after him Sergiopolis, and, on account of the signal miracles wrought 
in it, is honored by a great concourse of Christians. 
&mdash;At Rome, the holy martyrs Marcellus and Apuleius, who at first followed Simon Magus, but seeing 
the wonders which the Lord performed by the apostle 
Peter, abandoned Simon, and embraced the apostolical doctrine. After the death of the Apostles, under 
the ex-consul Aurelian, they won the crown of martyrdom, and were buried near the city.&mdash;Also, in the 
province of the Euphrates, St. Julia, virgin, who 
endured martyrdom under the governor Marcian. 
&mdash;At Padua, St. Justina, virgin and martyr, who was 
baptized by the blessed Prosdocimus, disciple of St. 
Peter. As she remained firm in the faith of Christ, 
she was put to the sword by order of the governor 
Maximus, and thus went to God.&mdash;At Bourges, St. 
Augustus, priest and confessor.&mdash;In the diocese of 
Rheims, St. Helanus, priest.&mdash;In Sweden, the translation of the body of St. Bridget, widow.

AT Bamberg, St. Henry I., emperor, who kept perpetual chastity with his wife Cunegunde, and
induced St. Stephen, king of Hungary, with nearly
all his kingdom, to receive the faith of Christ.&mdash;At
Porto, the birthday of the holy martyrs Eutropius,
and the sisters Zosima and Bonosa.&mdash;At Carthage,
blessed Catulinus, deacon, whose glories were proclaimed by St. Augustine in a sermon to his people,
and the Saints Januarius, Florentius, Julia and Justa, martyrs, who were entombed in the church of St.
Faustus.&mdash;At Alexandria, the holy martyrs Philip,
Zeno, Narseus, and ten children.&mdash;In the island of
Tenedos, St. Abudemius, a martyr, who suffered under Diocletian.&mdash;At Sebaste, St. Antiochus, a physician, who was decapitated under the governor Adrian. On seeing milk flowing from his wounds instead of blood, Cyriacus, his executioner, was converted to Christ and endured martyrdom.&mdash;At
Pavia, St. Felix, bishop and martyr.&mdash;At Nisibis,
the birthday of St. James, bishop of that city, a man
celebrated for great holiness, miracles and erudition. He was one of those who confessed the faith
during the persecution of Galerius Maximian, and
afterwards, in the Council of Nicaea, condemned the
perverse heresy of Arius, by opposing to it the doctrine of consubstantiality. It was also owing to his
prayers, and those of bishop Alexander, that Arius
received at Constantinople the condign punishment
of his iniquity, the extravasation of his intestines.&mdash;At Naples, in Campania, St. Athanasius, bishop of
that city, who suffered much from his wicked nephew
Sergius, by whom he was driven from his see. Consumed with afflictions, he departed for heaven at
Veroli, in the time of Charles the Bald.&mdash;At Palermo, the finding of the body of St. Rosalia, virgin of
Palermo. Being miraculously discovered in the time
of the Sovereign Pontiff, Urban VIII., it delivered
Sicily from the plague in the year of the Jubilee.

THE vigil of St. Thomas, apostle.&mdash;At Rome, the 
holy martyrs Liberatus and Bajulus.&mdash;At Alexandria, the holy martyrs Ammon, Zeno, Ptolemy, 
Ingen, and Theophilus, soldiers, who, standing near 
the tribunals, and seeing a Christian trembling under the torture and almost on the point of apostatizing, endeavored to encourage him by their looks and 
by signs, and when for this reason the whole people 
raised an outcry against them, they rushed forward, 
and declared themselves Christians. By their victory, Christ, who had given to them such fortitude, 
triumphed most gloriously.&mdash;At Gelduba, St. Julius, 
martyr.&mdash;In Arabia, the holy martyrs Eugene and 
Macarius, priests. For reproving Julian the Apostate for his impiety, they received a most severe 
scourging, were banished to a vast desert, and finally 
were put to the sword.&mdash;At Antioch, the birthday of 
St. Philogonius, bishop, who was called by the will 
of God from the practice of law to the government of 
that church. With the saintly bishop Alexander 
and other auxiliaries, he engaged the first combat for 
the Catholic faith against Arius, and, being renowned 
for merits, rested in the Lord. His festival was 
commemorated by St. John Chrysostom with an excellent panegyric.&mdash;At Brescia, St. Dominic, bishop 
and confessor.&mdash;In Spain, the departure from this 
world of St. Dominic de Sylos, abbot, of the Order 
of St. Benedict, most renowned for the miracles he 
wrought for the deliverance of captives.

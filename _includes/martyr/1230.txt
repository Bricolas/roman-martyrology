AT Spoleto, the birthday of the holy martyrs Sabinus, bishop, Exuperantius and Marcellus, deacons ; also of Venustian, governor, with his wife and 
sons, under the emperor Maximian. Marcellus and 
Exuperantius were first racked, then severely beaten 
with rods; afterwards being mangled with iron 
hooks, and burned in the sides, they terminated their 
martyrdom. Not long after, Venustian was put to 
the sword with his w-ife and sons. St. Sabinus,

confined in prison, was scourged to death. The martyrdom of these saints is commemorated on the same

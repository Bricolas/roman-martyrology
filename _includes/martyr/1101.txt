THE Festival of All Saints, which pope 
Boniface IV., after the dedication of the 
Pantheon, ordained to be kept generally 
and solemnly every year, in the city of 
Rome, in honor of the blessed Virgin Mary, Mother 
of God, and of the holy martyrs. It was afterwards 
decreed by Gregory IV. that this feast, which was 
then celebrated in many dioceses, but at different 
times, should be on this day perpetually and 
solemnly kept by the whole Church in honor of all 
the Saints.&mdash;At Terracina, in Campania, the birthday of St. Caesarius, deacon, who was for many 
days detained in prison, afterwards put into a sack 
with St. Julian, priest, and then precipitated into 
the sea.&mdash;At Dijon, St. Benignus, a priest, who 
was sent to France by blessed Polycarp to preach

condemned to have his neck struck with an iron 
bar and his body pierced with a lance.&mdash;The same 
day, St. Mary, handmaid. Accused of professing 
the Christian religion, in the time of the emperor 
Adrian, she was subjected to cruel scourging, to 
torture on the rack, and the lacerating of her body 
with iron hooks, and thus completed her martyrdom.&mdash;At Damascus, the martyrdom of the Saints 
Caesarius, Dacius and five others.&mdash;In Persia, under

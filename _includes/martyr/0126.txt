AT Smyrna, the birthday of St. Polycarp, a disciple of the Apostle 
St. John, who consecrated him bishop of that city and Primate of 
all Asia. Afterwards, under Marcus Antoninus and Lucius Aurelius Commodus, 
whilst the proconsul was sitting in judgment, and all the people in the 
amphitheatre were clamoring against him, he was condemned to the flames. 
But as he received no injury from them, he was transpierced with a sword, 
and thus received the crown of martyrdom. With him suffered in the same 
city twelve others from Philadelphia.&mdash;At Hippo Regius, in Africa, 
the holy bishop Theogenes and thirty-six others, who, despising temporal 
death, obtained the crown of eternal life in the persecution of 
Valerian.&mdash;At Bethlehem of Juda, the demise of St. Paula, widow, 
mother of St. Eustochium, virgin of Christ, who abandoned her worldly 
prospects, though she was descended from a noble line of senators, 
distributed her goods to the poor, and retired to the manger of our Lord, 
where, adorned with many virtues, and crowned with a long martyrdom, 
she departed for the kingdom of heaven. Her admirable life was written 
by St. Jerome.&mdash;In the diocese of Paris, the saintly queen Bathildis, 
illustrious by her sanctity and glorious miracles.

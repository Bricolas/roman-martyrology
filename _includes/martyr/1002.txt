THE feast of the holy Guardian Angels.&mdash;At Niomedia, St. Eleutherius, soldier and martyr, with 
numberless others. They were falsely accused of 
having set fire to the palace of Diocletian and, by 
order of this most cruel emperor, were barbarously 
massacred in groups. Some were put to the sword, 
some consumed by fire, while others were precipitated into the sea. But the principal one, Eleutherius, having endured long tortures, and being 
found stronger after each one, terminated his victorious martyrdom by fire, as well-tried gold.&mdash;In 
the vicinity of Arras, the martyrdom of blessed 
Leodegarius, bishop of Autun. After being subjected to various insults and torments for the truth, 
he was put to death by Ebroin, chief minister of 
Theodoric.&mdash;Also, the holy martyr Gerinus, brother 
of the blessed Leodegarius, who was overwhelmed 
with stones in the same city.&mdash;At Antioch, the holy 
martyrs Primus, Cyril, and Secundarius.&mdash;At Constantinople, St. Theophilus, a monk, who was most 
cruelly scourged by Leo the Isaurian, for the defence 
of holy images, was driven into exile, and went 
gloriously to heaven.&mdash;At Hereford, in England, St. 
Thomas, bishop and confessor.

AT Rome, the Dedication of the basilicas of the 
holy apostles Peter and Paul. The former, having been enlarged, was on this day solemnly consecrated by Urban VIII., while the latter, more 
sumptuously rebuilt after its total destruction by 
the flames, was solemnly dedicated on the 10th of 
December by Pius IX., though the festival in commemoration of that event was transferred to this 
day.&mdash;At Antioch, the birthday of St. Romanus, 
martyr, in the time of the emperor Galerius. When 
the prefect Asclepiades broke into the churches and 
strove to destroy them completely, Romanus exhorted the Christians to resist him, and after being 
subjected to dire torments and the cutting out of 
his tongue (without which, however, he spoke the 
praises of God), he was strangled in prison and 
crowned with a glorious martyrdom. Before him 
suffered a young boy named Barula, who being asked 
by him whether it was better to worship one God or 
several gods, and having answered that we must believe in the one God whom the Christians adore, was 
scourged and beheaded.&mdash;Also, at Antioch, the holy 
martyr Hesychius, a soldier. Hearing the order 
that anyone refusing to sacrifice to idols, should lay 
aside his military belt, he immediately took off 
his. For this reason, he was precipitated into the 
river with a large stone tied to his right hand.&mdash;The 
same day, the Saints Oriculus and his companions, 
who suffered for the Catholic faith, in the persecution of the Vandals.&mdash;At Mayence, St. Maximus, 
bishop, who, after suffering much from the Arians, 
died a confessor, in the time of Constantius.&mdash;At 
Tours, the departure from this life of blessed Odo, 
abbot of Cluny.&mdash;At Antioch, St. Thomas, a monk 
honored with an annual solemnity by the people of 
Antioch, for having obtained the cessation of a 
pestilence by his prayers.&mdash;At Lucca, in Tuscany, the 
translation of St. Frigdian, bishop and confessor.

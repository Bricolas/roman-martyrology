THE feast of St. Lawrence Justinian, first Patriarch of Venice, who, by glorious miracles and 
virtues, illustrated the episcopal dignity which he 
received against his will on this day. His birthday is the 8th of January.&mdash;In the suburbs of Rome, 
blessed Victorinus, bishop and martyr, in the time 
of Nerva Trajan. Being renowned for sanctity and 
miracles, he was elected bishop of Amiterno by the 
whole people, but afterwards he was banished, with 
other servants of God, to Contigliano, where spring 
forth fetid sulphurous waters, and was suspended 
with his head downward by order of the judge Aurelian. Having for the name of Christ endured this 
torment for three days, he was gloriously crowned, 
and went victoriously to our Lord. His body was 
taken away by the Christians, and buried with due 
honors at Araiterno.&mdash;Also, at Porto, the birthday 
of St. Herculanus, martyr.&mdash;At Capua, the holy 
martyrs Quinctius, Arcontius, and Donatus.&mdash;The 
same day, St. Romulus, prefect of Trajan's court. 
For reproving the cruelty of the emperor towards 
Christians, he was scourged with rods, and beheaded. 
&mdash;At Melitine, in Armenia, the martyrdom of the 
holy soldiers Eudoxius, Zeno, Macarius, and their 
companions to the number of eleven hundred and 
four, who threw away their military belts, and were 
put to death for the confession of Christ, in the persecution of Diocletian.&mdash;At Constantinople, the holy 
martyrs Urbanus, Theodore, Menedemus, and their 
ecclesiastical companions, seventy-seven in number,

faith.&mdash;In the neighborhood of Terouanne, in the

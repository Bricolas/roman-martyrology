AT Nicomedia, the holy martyrs Dorotheus and 
Gorgonius. The greatest honors had been conferred on them by the emperor Diocletian, but as 
they detested the cruelty which he exercised against 
the Christians, they were by his order suspended in 
his presence, and lacerated with whips; then their 
skin being torn from their bodies, and vinegar with 
salt poured over them, they were burned on a gridiron and finally strangled. After some time, the 
body of blessed Gorgonius was brought to Rome, and 
deposited on the Latin road. Thence it was transferred to the basilica of St. Peter.&mdash;Among the Sabines, thirty miles from Rome, the holy martyrs 
Hyacinthus, Alexander, and Tiburtius.&mdash;At Sebaste, 
St. Severian, a soldier of the emperor Licinius. For 
frequently visiting the Forty Martyrs whilst they 
were in prison, he was suspended in the air with a 
stone tied to his feet by order of the governor Lysias, 
and being scourged and torn with whips, yielded up 
his soul in the midst of torments.&mdash;The same day, 
St. Straton, who ended his martyrdom for Christ by 
being tied to two trees and torn to pieces.&mdash;Also, the 
holy martyrs Rufinus and Rufinian, brothers.&mdash;At 
Rome, St. Sergius, pope and confessor.&mdash;In the 
territory of TÃ©rouanne, St. Omer, bishop.&mdash;In Ireland, St. Kieran, abbot.&mdash;At Cartagena, in South 
America, St. Peter Claver, confessor of the Society 
of Jesus, who labored with, wonderful self-abnegation and great charity among the negro slaves for 
more than forty years and baptized personally almost thirty thousand of them. He was canonized 
by order of pope Leo XIII.

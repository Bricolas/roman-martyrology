AT Alexandria, the birthday of St. Athanasius,
bishop of that city and Doctor of the Church,
most celebrated for sanctity and learning. Although
almost all the world had formed a conspiracy to
persecute him, he courageously defended the Catholic
faith, from the reign of Constantine to that of Valens, against emperors, governors, and a multitude
of Arian bishops, whose perfidious attacks forced
him to wander as an exile over the whole earth without finding a place of security. At length, however,
he was restored to his church, and after fighting
many combats, and winning many crowns by his
patience, he departed for heaven in the forty-sixth
year of his priesthood, in the time of the emperors
Valentinian and Valens.&mdash;At Rome, the holy martyrs Saturninus, Neopolus, Germanus, and Celestine,
who after much suffering were thrown into prison,
where they rested in the Lord.&mdash;Also the holy martyrs Exuperius and Zoe, his wife, with their sons,
Cyriacus and Theodulus, who suffered under the
emperor Adrian.&mdash;At Seville, St. Felix, deacon and
martyr.&mdash;The same day, St. Vindemial, bishop and
martyr, who with the holy bishops Eugenius and
Longinus, combated the Arians by his teaching and
miracles, and was decapitated by order of king
Hunneric.&mdash;At Avila, in Spain, St. Secundus, bishop,
who is also mentioned with others on the 15th of
this month.&mdash;At Florence, the bishop St. Antoninus,
of the Order of Preachers, renowned for holiness
and learning. His feast is kept on the 10th of this
month.

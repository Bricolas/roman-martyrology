THE vigil of St. Matthew, apostle and evangelist 
&mdash;At Rome, the holy martyrs Eustachius, and Theopistes, his wife, with their two sons, Agapitus and 
Theopistus. Under the emperor Adrian, they were 
condemned to be cast to the beasts, but through the 
power of God, being uninjured by them, they were 
shut up in a burning brazen ox, and thus terminated 
their martyrdom.&mdash;At Cyzicum, on the sea of Marmora, the birthday of the holy martyrs Pausta, 
virgin, and Evilasius, in the time of the emperor 
Maximian. Fausta had her head shaved to shame 
her, and was hanged up and tortured by Evilasius, 
then a Pagan priest; but when he wished to have her 
body cut in two, the executioners could not inflict 
any injury on her. Amazed at this prodigy, Evilasius believed in Christ; and whilst he was cruelly 
tortured by order of the emperor, Fausta had her 
head bored through, and her whole body pierced 
with nails. She was then laid on a burning pan, 
and being called by a celestial voice, went in company with Evilasius to enjoy the blessedness of 
heaven.&mdash;In Phrygia, the holy martyrs Denis and 
Privatus.&mdash;Also, St. Priscus, martyr, who, after 
having had his body pierced all over with daggers, 
was beheaded.&mdash;At Pergen, in Pamphylia, the Saints 
Theodore, his mother Philippa, and their fellow martyrs, under the emperor Antoninus.&mdash;At Carthage, 
St. Candida, virgin and martyr; who, having all her 
body lacerated with whips, was crowned with martyrdom, under the emperor Maximian.&mdash;Also, the 
holy martyr Susanna, daughter of Arthemius, a 
Pagan priest, and Martha.&mdash;The same day, pope St. 
Agapitus, whose sanctity is attested by blessed 
Gregory the Great.&mdash;At Milan, St. Clicerius, bishop 
and confessor.

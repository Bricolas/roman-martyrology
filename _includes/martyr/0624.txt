torches in the night. All these were disciples of the
Apostles, and the first fruits of the martyrs, which
the Roman Church, a field so fertile in martyrs,
offered to God before the death of the Apostles.&mdash;In
the same city, the holy martyrs Faustus and twenty-three others.&mdash;At Satalis, in Armenia, seven saintly

from one another, hurried away to various places,
and in the midst of painful trials, found their repose in the Lord.&mdash;In the diocese of Paris, at Creteil,

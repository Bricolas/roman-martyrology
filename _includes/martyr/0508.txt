holy martyr Victor, a Moor. He became a Christian
in his youth, and served as soldier in the imperial
army. When Maximian wished to force him to offer
sacrifice to idols, he persevered with the greatest
fortitude in the confession of the Lord. Being first
beaten with rods, but without experiencing any pain,
through the protection of God, and then having
melted lead poured over him, which did him no
injury whatever, he at length terminated the career
of his glorious martyrdom by being beheaded.&mdash;At
Constantinople, in the persecution of Diocletian and
Maximian, St. Acathius, a centurion, who, being denounced as a Christian by the tribune Firmus, and
cruelly tortured at Perinthus by the judge Bibian,
was finally condemned to death at Byzantium by the
proconsul Flaccinus. His body was afterwards
miraculously brought to the shore of Syllacium,
where it is preserved with due honor.&mdash;At Vienne,
St Denis, bishop and confessor.&mdash;At Auxerre, St.
Helladius, bishop.&mdash;In the diocese of Besancon, St.
Peter, bishop.&mdash;In Ireland, St. Wiro, bishop.

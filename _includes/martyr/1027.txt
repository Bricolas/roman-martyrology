THE vigil of the holy apostles Simon and Jude. 
&mdash;At Avila, in Spain, the Saints Vincent, Sabina 
and Christeta, who were first stretched on the rack 
in such a manner that all their limbs were dislocated; 
then stones being laid on their heads, and their 
brains beaten out with heavy bars, they terminated 
their martyrdom under the governor Dacian.&mdash;At 
Tilchatel, St. Florentius, martyr.&mdash;In Cappadocia, 
the holy martyrs Capitolina, and Erotheides, her 
handmaid, who suffered under Diocletian.&mdash;In India, 
St. Frumentius, bishop. While he was a captive 
there he was consecrated bishop by St. Athanasius, 
and preached the Gospel in that country.&mdash;In Ethiopia, St. Elesbaan, king, who, after having defeated 
the enemies of Christ and sent his royal diadem to 
Jerusalem, in the time of the emperor Justin, led a 
monastical life, as he had vowed, and went to his 
reward.

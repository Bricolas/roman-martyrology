IN Sicily, in the reign of Diocletian, the birthday
of seventy-nine holy martyrs, who deserved by
various torments to receive an immortal crown for
the confession of their faith.—At Adrumetum, in
Africa, during the persecution of the Vandals, the
holy martyrs Verulus, Secundinus, Syricius, Felix,
Servulus, Saturninus, Fortunatus, and sixteen others, who were crowned with martyrdom for the
confession of the Catholic faith.—At Scythopolis, in
Palestine, St. Severian, bishop and martyr.—At
Damascus, St. Peter Mavimenus, who was killed by
some Arabs who visited him in his sickness, because
he said to them: “Whoever does not embrace the
Christian and Catholic faith is lost, like your false
prophet Mahomet.”—At Ravenna, St. Maximian,
bishop and confessor.—At Metz, St. Felix, bishop.

At Brescia, St. Paterius, bishop.

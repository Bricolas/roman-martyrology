IN Africa, the holy martyrs Rufinus, Mark, Valerius and their companions.&mdash;The same day, the 
holy martyrs Elpidius, Marcellus, Eustochius, and 
their companions. Elpidius being a senator, and 
having perseveringly confessed the Christian faith 
before Julian the Apostate, was, with his companions, first tied to wild horses and dragged by 
them, and then being thrown into the fire, ended a 
glorious martyrdom.&mdash;At Lyons, the birthday of St. 
Eucherius, bishop and confessor, a man of extraordinary faith and learning. He renounced the senatorial dignity to embrace the religious life, and for a 
long time voluntarily shut himself up in a cavern, 
where he served Christ in prayer and fasting. Afterwards, through the revelation of an angel, he was 
solemnly installed in the episcopal chair of the city 
of Lyons.&mdash;At Padua, St. Fidentius, bishop.&mdash;At 
Canterbury, in England, St. Edmund, archbishop 
and confessor, who was sent into exile for having 
maintained the rights of his church. He died near 
Provins, in France, and was canonized by Innocent 
IV. &mdash;The same day, the departure from this world 
of St. Othmar, abbot.

AT Thecua, in Palestine, the holy prophet Amos,
whom the priest Amasias frequently scourged,
and whose temples Ozias, that priest’s son, pierced
with an iron spike. Being carried half dead to his
native place, he expired there and was buried with
his forefathers.&mdash;In Africa, the holy martyrs Theodulus, Anesius, Felix, Cornelia, and their companions.&mdash;In Persia, during the reign of king Isdegerdes,
St. Benjamin, deacon. Because he would not cease
to preach the Word of God, sharp-pointed reeds were
forced under his nails, a thorny stake driven through
his entrails, and thus he consummated his martyrdom.&mdash;At Rome, the holy virgin Balbina, daughter
of the blessed martyr Quirinus, who was baptized
by pope St. Alexander, and after overcoming the
world, was buried on the Appian road at her father’s
side.

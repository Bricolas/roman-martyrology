AT Ephesus, the birthday of St. John, apostle and 
evangelist, who, after writing his gospel, and 
after enduring exile and writing the divine Apocalypse, lived till the time of the emperor Trajan, 
and founded and governed the churches of all Asia. 
Worn out with age, he died in the sixty-eighth year 
after the passion of our Lord, and was buried near 
Ephesus.&mdash;At Alexandria, St. Maximus, bishop, who 
became a renowned and distinguished confessor of 
the faith.&mdash;At Constantinople, the holy confessors 
Theodore and Theophanes, brothers, who were 
brought up from their childhood in the monastery 
of St. Sabbas. Afterwards, combating bravely for 
the worship of holy images against Leo the Armenian, they were scourged by his command and banished. After his death, they again firmly opposed 
the emperor Theophilus, who was imbued with the 
same impiety, and were scourged a second time and 
driven into exile, where Theodore expired in prison. 
Theophanes, after peace had at length been restored 
to the Church, was made bishop of Niaea and rested 
in the Lord.&mdash;In the same city, St. Niceras, virgin, 
who was renowned for sanctity, in the time of the 
emperor Arcadius.

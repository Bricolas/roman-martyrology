THE birthday of the blessed apostles Simon the 
Cananean, and Thaddeus, who is called Jude. 
Simon preached the Gospel in Egypt, Thaddeus in 
Mesopotamia. Afterwards, entering Persia together, 
they converted to Christ a numberless multitude of 
the inhabitants, and then underwent martyrdom.

through the throat for the faith of Christ.&mdash;In the 
same city, the holy martyrs Anastasia the Elder, 
virgin, and Cyril.&mdash;In the persecution of Valerian, 
under the prefect Probus, Anastasia was bound with 
chains, buffeted, subjected to fire and scourging, and, 
as she remained immovable in the confession of 
Christ, her breasts were cut off, her nails plucked 
out, her teeth broken, and her hands, feet and head 
severed from her body. Bedecked with her sufferings as with so many jewels, she went to her spouse. 
At her request, Cyril gave her some water to drink, 
and for his reward became a martyr.&mdash;At Como, St. 
Fidelis, martyr, under the emperor Maximian.&mdash;At 
Mayence, St. Ferrutius, martyr.&mdash;At Meaux, SL

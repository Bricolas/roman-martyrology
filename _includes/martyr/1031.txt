THE vigil of All Saints.&mdash;At Rome, the birthday 
of blessed Nemesius, deacon, and his daughter, 
the virgin Lucilla. As they could not be prevailed 
upon to abandon the faith of Christ, they were beheaded on the 25th of August by order of the emperor Valerian. Their bodies were buried by the 
blessed pope Stephen, and afterwards more decently 
entombed on this day, on the Appian road, by 
blessed Xystus. Gregory V. translated them into 
the sacristy of Santa Maria Nova, together with the 
Saints Symphronius, Olympius, tribune, Exuperia, 
his wife, and Theodulus, his son, who, being all converted by the exertions of Symphronius, and baptized by the same St. Stephen, had been crowned 
with martyrdom. These holy bodies were found 
there during the Pontificate of Gregory XIII., and 
placed more honorably beneath the altar of the same 
church, on the 8th of December.&mdash;The same day, the 
Saints Ampliatus, Urbanus and Narcissus, who are 
mentioned by St. Paul in his epistle to the Romans. 
They were put to death by the Jews and Gentiles for 
the Gospel of Christ.&mdash;At Saint-Quentin, in France, 
St. Quinctinus, Roman citizen and senator, who endured martyrdom under the emperor Maximian. By 
the revelation of an angel, his body was found incorrupt after the lapse of fifty-five years.&mdash;At Constantinople, St. Stachis, bishop, who was consecrated first

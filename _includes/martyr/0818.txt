AT Palestrina, the birthday of the holy martyr
Agapitus. Although only fifteen years of age,
as he was fervent in the love of Christ, he was
arrested by order of the emperor Aurelian, and
scourged a long time. Afterwards, under the prefect Antiochus, he endured more severe torments,
and being delivered to the lions by the emperor’s
order without receiving any injury, he was finally
struck with the sword, and thus merited his crown.

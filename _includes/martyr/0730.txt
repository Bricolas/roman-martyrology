AT Rome, in the reign of Decius, the holy Persian
martyrs Abdon and Sennen, who were bound
with chains, brought to Rome, scourged with leaded
whips for the faith of Christ, and then put to the
sword.&mdash;At Tuberbum Lucernarium, in Africa, the
holy virgins and martyrs Maxima, Donatilla, and Secunda. The first two, in the persecution of Valerian
and Gallienus, were forced to drink vinegar and gall,
then scourged most severely, and stretched on the
rack, burned on the gridiron, rubbed over with lime,
afterwards exposed to the beasts with the virgin
Secunda, twelve years old, but being untouched by
them, they were finally beheaded.&mdash;At Assisi, in
Umbria, St. Rufinus, martyr.&mdash;At Caesarea, in Cappadocia, St. Julitta, martyr. As she sought to recover through the courts the restitution of goods
seized by an influential personage, the latter objected that, being a Christian, her cause could not be
pleaded. The judge commanded her to offer sacrifice
to the idols, that she might be heard. With great
firmness, she refused, and being thrown into the
fire, yielded her spirit to God, though her body remained uninjured by the flames. St. Basil the Great
has proclaimed her praise in an excellent eulogy.&mdash;
At Auxerre, St. Ursus, bishop and confessor.

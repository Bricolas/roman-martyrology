IN Poland, St. John Cantius, priest and confessor. 
Being glorious for virtues and miracles, he was 
inscribed among the saints by the Sovereign Pontiff, Clement XIII.&mdash;At Abia, near Aquila, in Abruzzo, the birthday of blessed Maximus, deacon and 
martyr, who, through the desire of suffering, presented himself to the persecutors that sought him. 
After answering with great constancy, he was racked 
and tortured, then beaten with rods, and finally he 
died by being precipitated from an elevated place. 
&mdash;At Agen, in France, St. Caprasius, martyr. As he 
was hiding himself in a cavern to avoid the violence 
of the persecution, the report of the blessed virgin 
Faith's courage in suffering for Christ animated him 
to endure torments, and he prayed to God that, if he 
were deemed worthy of the glory of martyrdom, 
clear water might flow from the rock of his cavern. 
God having granted his prayer, he went with confidence to the scene of combat, and after a valiant 
struggle, merited the palm of martyrdom under 
Maximian.&mdash;At Antioch, St. Artemius, imperial officer. Although he had filled high stations in the 
army under Constantine the Great, Julian the Apostate, whom he had reprehended for his cruelty towards Christians, ordered him to be beaten with 
rods, subjected to other torments, and finally beheaded.&mdash;At Cologne, the martyrdom of the holy 
virgins Martha and Saula, with many others.&mdash;At 
Minden, the birthday of St. Felician, bishop and 
martyr.&mdash;At Paris, the holy martyrs, George, deacon, 
and Aurelius.&mdash;In Portugal, St. Irene, virgin and 
martyr.&mdash;In the diocese of Rheims, St. Sindulphus, 
confessor.

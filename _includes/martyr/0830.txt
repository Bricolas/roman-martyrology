THE feast of St. Kose of St. Mary, virgin, whose 
birthday is the 26th of this month. At Rome, 
on the Ostian road, the martyrdom of the blessed 
priest Felix, under the emperors Diocletian and 
Maximian. After being racked he was sentenced 
to death, and as they led him to execution, he met 
a man who spontaneously declared himself a Chris- 
tian, and was forthwith beheaded with him. The 
Christians not knowing his name, called him Adauc- 
tus, because he was added to St. Felix and shared 
his crown. Also, at Rome, St. Gaudentia, virgin and 
martyr, with three others. In the same city, St. 
Pammachius, a priest distinguished for learning and 
holiness. At Colonia Suffetulana, in Africa, sixty 
blessed martyrs, who were murdered by the furious 
Gentiles. At Adrumetum, also in Africa, the Saints 
Boniface and Thecla, who were the parents of twelve 
blessed sons, martyrs. At Thessalonica, St. Fanti- 
nus, confessor, who suffered much from the Saracens, 
and was driven from his monastery, in which he had 
lived in great abstinence. After having brought 
many to the way of salvation, he rested at last at an 
advanced age. In the diocese of Meaux, St. Fiacre, 
confessor. At Trevi, St. Peter, confessor, who was 
distinguished for many virtues and miracles. He is 
honored in that place, whence he departed for 
heaven. At Bologna, St. Bononius, abbot.

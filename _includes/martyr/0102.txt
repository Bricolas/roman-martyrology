THE Octave of St. Stephen, the first martyr.&mdash;At 
Rome, the commemoration of many holy martyrs, 
who, despising the edict of the emperor Diocletian, 
which ordered that the sacred books should be delivered up, preferred to surrender themselves to the 
executioners rather than to give holy things to 
dogs.&mdash;At Antioch, the passion of blessed Isidore, 
bishop.&mdash;At Tomis, in Pontus, in the time of the 
emperor Licinius, three holy brothers, Argeus, Narcissus, and the young man Marcellinus. This last, 
being enrolled among the new soldiers, and refusing 
to serve, was beaten almost to death, and for a long 
time kept in prison. Being finally cast into the 
sea, he finished his martyrdom; but his brothers 
were beheaded.&mdash;At Milan, St. Martinian, bishop. 
&mdash;In Nitria, in Egypt, blessed Isidore, bishop and confessor.&mdash;The same day, St. Siridion, bishop.&mdash;In Thebais, St. Macarius of Alexandria, abbot.

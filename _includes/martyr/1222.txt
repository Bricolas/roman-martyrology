AT Rome, between the two bay trees on the Lavican 
road, the birthday of thirty holy martyrs, who 
were all on one day crowned with martyrdom, in the 
persecution of Diocletian.&mdash;In the same city, St. 
Flavian, ex-prefect, who, under Julian the Apostate, 
was condemned to be branded for Christ, and banished to Aquae Taurinae, where he gave up his soul 
to God in prayer.&mdash;At Ostia, the holy martyrs Demetrius, Honoratus and Florus.&mdash;At Alexandria, the 
holy martyr Ischyrion. Because he dispised all the 
cruelties they made him suffer to force him to sacrifice to idols, they transpierced his bowels with a 
sharp-pointed stake, and thus put him to death.&mdash;In 
Egypt, the Saint Chaeremon, bishop of Nilopolis, and 
many other martyrs. Some of them fled whilst the 
persecution of Decius was raging, and wandering in 
different directions through deserts, were killed by 
wild beasts; others perished by famine, cold and 
sickness; others again were murdered by barbarians 
and robbers, and thus all were crowned with a 
glorious martyrdom.&mdash;At Nicomedia, St. Zeno, soldier, who derided Diocletian for sacrificing to Ceres, 
wherefore he had his jawbones fractured, his teeth 
plucked out and his head struck off.

AT Arenas, in Spain, St. Peter of Alcantara, confessor, of the Order of Minorites, who was canonized by Clement IX. on account of his admirable 
penance and many miracles.&mdash;At Rome, the birthday 
of the holy martyrs Ptolemy and Lucius, under Marcus Antoninus. The former, as we learn from the 
martyr Justin, having converted an immodest woman 
to the faith of Christ, and taught her to practise 
chastity, was accused by a profligate man before the 
prefect Urbicius, and condemned to languish a long 
time in a filthy dungeon. At length, as he declared 
by a public confession that Christ was his master, 
he was led to execution. Lucius disapproving the 
sentence of Urbicius, and avowing freely that he was 
a Christian, received the same sentence. To them 
was added a third, who was condemned to suffer a 
like punishment.&mdash;At Antioch, the holy martyrs 
Beronicus, the virgin Pelagia and forty-nine others. 
&mdash;In Egypt, St. Varus, soldier, under the emperor 
Maximinus. He used to visit and comfort seven 
saintly monks detained in prison, when one of them 
happening to die, he wished to take his place, and 
having suffered with them cruel afflictions, he obtained the palm of martyrdom.&mdash;At Evreux, St. 
Aquilinus, bishop and confessor.&mdash;In the diocese of 
Orleans, the departure from this world of St. Veranus, bishop.&mdash;At Salerno, St. Eusterius, bishop.&mdash;In

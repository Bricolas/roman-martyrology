THE vigil of St. Andrew, apostle.&mdash;At Rome, on 
the Salarian road, the birthday of the holy martyr Saturninus, an aged man, and the deacon Sisinius, in the time of the emperor Maximian. After 
a long imprisonment, they were, by order of the prefect of the city, placed on the rack, distended with 
ropes, scourged with rods and whips garnished with 
metal, then exposed to the flames, taken down from 
the rack and beheaded.&mdash;At Toulouse, in the time of 
Decius, the holy bishop Saturninus, who was confined by the Pagans in the capitol of that city, and 
from the highest part of the building precipitated 
down the stairs; by which fall, having his head 
crushed, his brains dashed out and his whole body 
mangled, he rendered his worthy soul to our Lord. 
&mdash;Also, the martyrdom of the Saints Paramon and his 
companions, to the number of three hundred and 
seventy-five, under the emperor Decius and the governor Aquilinus.&mdash;At Ancyra, St. Philomenus, martyr. During the persecution of the emperor Aurelian, under the governor Felix, he was first exposed 
to the flames, then having his hands, feet and head 
pierced with nails, consummated his martyrdom. 
&mdash;At Veroli, the holy martyrs Blasius and Demetrius. 
&mdash;At Todi, St. Illuminata, virgin.

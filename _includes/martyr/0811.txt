AT Rome, between the two laurels situated about
three miles from the city, the birthday of St.
Tiburtius, martyr, under the judge Fabian, in the
persecution of Diocletian. After he had walked
barefoot on burning coals and confessed Christ
with increased constancy, he was put to the sword.
&mdash;Also, at Rome, the holy virgin Susanna, a woman
of noble race, and niece of the blessed Pontiff
Caius. She merited the palm of martyrdom by
being beheaded in the time of Diocletian.&mdash;At
Comana, in Pontus, St. Alexander, bishop, surnamed Carbonarius, who added to a consummate
knowledge of philosophy an eminent degree of
Christian humility. He was promoted to the See
of that church by St. Gregory Thaumaturgus, and
became illustrious, not only by preaching, but also
by suffering martyrdom by fire.&mdash;The same day,
the martyrdom of St. Rufinus, bishop of the Marsi,
and his companions, under the emperor Maximinus.
&mdash;At Evreux, in France, St. Taurinus, bishop. Being made bishop of that city by the blessed pope
Clement, he propagated the Christian faith by the
preaching of the Gospel, and the many labors he
sustained for it. Celebrated for glorious miracles,
he slept in the Lord.&mdash;At Cambrai, in France, St.
Gaugericus, bishop and confessor.&mdash;In the province
of Valeria, St. Equitius, abbot, whose sanctity is
attested by the blessed pope Gregory.&mdash;At Todi, St.

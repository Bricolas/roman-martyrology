THE Saints Cornelius and Cyprian, pontiffs and 
martyrs, whose birthday is the 14th of this 
month.&mdash;At Chalcedon, the birthday of St. Euphemia, virgin and martyr, under the emperor Diocletian and the proconsul Priscus. For faith in our 
Lord she was subjected to tortures, imprisonment, 
blows, the torment of the wheel, fire, the crushing 
weight of stones, the teeth of beasts, scourging with 
rods, the cutting of sharp saws, burning pans, all of 
which she survived. But when she was again exposed to the beasts in the amphitheatre, praying to 
our Lord to receive her spirit, one of the animals 
having inflicted a bite on her sacred body, whilst the 
rest licked her feet, she yielded her unspotted soul 
to God.&mdash;At Rome, the holy martyrs Lucia, noble 
matron, and Geminian, who were subjected to most 
grievous afflictions and a long time tortured, by the 
command of the emperor Diocletian. Finally, being 
put to the sword, they obtained the glorious victory 
of martyrdom.&mdash;Also, at Rome, at a place on the 
Flaminian road, ten miles from the city, the holy 
martyrs Abundius, priest, and Abundantius, deacon, whom the emperor Diocletian caused to be 
struck with the sword, together with Marcian, an 
illustrious man, and his son John, whom they had 
raised from the dead.&mdash;At Heraclea, in Thrace, St. 
Sebastiana, martyr, under the emperor Domitian 
and the governor Sergius. Being brought to the 
faith of Christ by the blessed apostle Paul, she was 
tormented in various ways and finally beheaded. 
At Cordova, the holy martyrs Rogellus and Servideus, who were decapitated, after their hands and 
feet had been cut off.&mdash;In Scotland, St. Ninian, 
bishop and confessor.&mdash;In England, St. Editha, virgin, daughter of the English king Edgar, who was 
consecrated to God in a monastery from her tender 
years, whence she may be said to have been ignorant 
of the world rather than to have forsaken it.

who, while yet children, were put to the sword, after
they had endured cruel torments and performed
many miracles.&mdash;At Constantinople, the holy martyrs Lucillian and four boys, Claudius, Hypatius,
Paul, and Denis. Lucillian, formerly a pagan priest,
but now a Christian, was cast into a furnace with
them, after undergoing many torments; but the

uninjured. Finally, under the governor Silvanus,
they terminated their career; Lucillian, by crucifixion, the children, by decapitation.&mdash;In the same
city, St. Paula, virgin and martyr, who was arrested
whilst gathering the blood of the martyrs just mentioned, beaten with rods, and thrown into the fire,
from which she was delivered. Finally, when St.
Lucillian had been crucified, she was decapitated.

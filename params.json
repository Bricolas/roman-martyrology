{"name":"Roman Martyrology","tagline":"saint of the day, vintage divine office style","body":"### Roman Martyrology\r\n\r\nSome versions of the Divine Office involved reciting a list of the saints to be commemorated.  The one I am familiar with asks for tomorrows saints to be remembered at Prime, the first hour of the day, roughly 6am.\r\n\r\nThere are scanned in versions of the Roman Martyrology in the Internet Archive, but I thought it would be handy to have a javascript version that pulled in the listing for the day's saint automatically.\r\n\r\nThere are other Saint of the Day webpages which are awesome - especially http://saints.sqpn.com/today-on-the-calendar/ - but not so easy to read out as the Martyrology books which are specially made for that purpose.\r\n\r\nI am endeavouring to keep ahead of the current day as we go through the year.  I'm using OCR on https://archive.org/details/romanmartyrology00cathuoft which I have also set up as [a paperback on Lulu:](http://www.lulu.com/shop/benedict-xiv/roman-martyrology/paperback/product-21821878.html).","google":"UA-43339125-1","note":"Don't delete this file!

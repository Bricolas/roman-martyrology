IN Galatia, St. Crescens, disciple of the blessed
apostle Paul. In passing through Gaul, he converted many to the Christian faith by his preaching.
Returning to the people for whom especially he had
been made bishop, he maintained, to the end of his
life, the Galatians in the service of the Lord, and
finally consummated his martyrdom under Trajan.&mdash;
At Cordova, St. Zoilus, and nineteen other martyrs.
&mdash;At Caesarea, in Palestine, in the persecution of
Diocletian, under the governor Urbanus, St. Anectus, martyr. For having exhorted others to suffer
martyrdom, and overthrown idols by his prayers, he
was scourged by ten soldiers, had his hands and feet
cut off, and by decapitation merited the crown of
martyrdom.&mdash;At Constantinople, St. Sampson, a
priest who harbored the poor.&mdash;At Warasdin, in
Hungary, the holy king Ladislas, greatly renowned
to this day for miracles.

through many torments attained to martyrdom rejoicing.&mdash;At Tyre, St. Dorotheus, a priest, who suffered much under Diocletian, but survived until the
reign of Julian, under whom his venerable age was
crowned with martyrdom, he being then one hundred
and seven years old.&mdash;At Cordova, in Spain, blessed
Sancius, a youth, who, though brought up in the
royal court, did not hesitate to undergo martyrdom

AT Caesarea, in Palestine, during the persecution
of Valerian, the holy martyrs Marinus, soldier,
and Asterius, senator. The former was examined
by the judge on the charge laid against him by his
fellow-soldiers of being a Christian, and as he admitted the accusation in no uncertain tone, he was
beheaded and thus received the crown of martyrdom.
His mutilated body was taken up by Asterius on his
shoulders, and wrapped in the garment which he
himself wore. This service gained for Asterius immediately the palm of martyrdom as a reward for
the honors which he had given to a martyr.&mdash;In
Spain, the birthday of the holy martyrs Hermiterius
and Cheledonius, soldiers in the army at Leon, a city
of Galicia. On the approach of a persecution they
went to Calahorra, in order to confess the name of
Christ, and after enduring many torments there,
they were crowned with martyrdom.&mdash;The same day,
the passion of the Saints Felix, Luciolus, Fortunatus, Marcia, and their companions.&mdash;Also, the holy
soldiers Cleonicus, Eutropius, and Basiliscus, who
gloriously triumphed by the death of the cross under
the governor Asclepiades during the persecution of
Maximian.&mdash;At Brescia, St. Titian, bishop and confessor.&mdash;At Bamberg, the empress St. Cunegundes,
who preserved her virginity with the consent of her
husband, the emperor Henry I. She terminated a
life rich in meritorius good deeds with a holy death
and worked many miracles afterward.

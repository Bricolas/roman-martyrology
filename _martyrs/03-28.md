ST. JOHN of Capistran, confessor, who is mentioned on the 23d of October.&mdash;At Caesarea, in
Palestine, the birthday of the holy martyrs Priscus,
Malchus, and Alexander. In the persecution of
Valerian, they were dwelling in the suburbs of Caesarea, but knowing that in the city the heavenly
crown of martyrdom was to be gained, and burning
with the divine ardor of faith, they go to the judge
of their own accord, rebuke him, for shedding the
blood of the faithful in torrents, and are forthwith
condemned to be devoured by beasts for the name
of Christ.&mdash;At Tarsus, in Cilicia, the holy martyrs
Castor and Dorotheus.&mdash;In Africa, the holy martyrs
Rogatus, Successus, and sixteen others.&mdash;At Rome,
St. Xystus III., pope and confessor.&mdash;At Norcia, the
abbot St. Speus, a man of extraordinary patience,
whose soul at its departure from this life was seen
by all his brethren to ascend to heaven in the shape
of a dove.&mdash;At Chalons, in France, the demise of St.
Gontram, king, who devoted himself to exercises of
piety, renounced the pomps of the world, and bestowed his treasures on churches and the poor.

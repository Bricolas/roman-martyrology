IN Tuscany, on Mount Senario, the seven Holy Founders of the Order of Servites of the Blessed Virgin Mary. After a most austere kind of life, they died a death precious in the Lord, with a reputation for merits and prodigies. As one spirit of true fraternal love united them in life, and as the people joined them together in the same veneration after death, Leo. XIII. placed them together in the catalogue of the Saints.&mdash;At Barcelona, in Spain, in the time of the emperor Diocletian, St. Eulalia, virgin, who, being racked, torn with iron hooks, cast into the fire, and crucified, received the glorious crown of martyrdom.&mdash;In Africa, St. Damian, soldier and martyr.&mdash;At Carthage, the holy martyr Modestus and Julian.&mdash;At Benevento, St. Modestus, deacon and martyr.&mdash;At Alexandria, the holy children Modestus and Ammonius.&mdash;At Antioch, St. Meletius, a bishop, who often suffered exile for the Catholic faith, and finally died at Constantinople and went to his reward. His virtues have been highly extolled by St. John Chrysostom and St. Gregory of Nyssa.&mdash;At Constantinople, St. Anthony, a bishop in the time of the emperor Leo VI.&mdash;At Verona, St. Gaudentius, bishop and confessor.

THE vigil of St. James, apostle.&mdash;At Tyro,
in Tuscany, on lake Bolsena, St. Christina,
virgin and martyr. Believing in Christ, and
breaking up her fatherâ€™s gold and silver idols
to give them to the poor, she was cruelly scourged
by his command, subjected to other most severe torments, and thrown with a heavy stone into the lake,
from which she was drawn out by an angel. Then
under another judge, who succeeded her father, she
bore courageously still more bitter tortures. Finally,
after she had been shut up by the governor Julian
in a burning furnace for five days without any injury, and after being cured of the sting of serpents,
she ended her martyrdom by having her tongue cut
out, and being pierced with arrows.&mdash;At Rome, on
the Tiburtine road, St. Vincent, martyr.&mdash;At Amiterno, in Abruzzo, the martyrdom of eighty-three

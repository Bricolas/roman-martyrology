IN Ireland, the birthday of St. Patrick, bishop and
confessor, who was the first to preach Christ in
that country, and became illustrious by great miracles and virtues.&mdash;At Jerusalem, St. Joseph of
Arimathea, noble senator and disciple of our Lord,
who took his body down from the cross, and buried
it in his own new sepulchre.&mdash;At Rome, the Saints
Alexander and Theodore, martyrs.&mdash;At Alexandria,
the commemoration of many holy martyrs, who being
seized by the worshippers of Serapis, and refusing
constantly to adore that idol, were cruelly murdered,
in the reign of the emperor Theodosius, who afterwards issued orders that the temple of Serapis
should be destroyed.&mdash;At Constantinople, St. Paul,
martyr, who was burned alive under Constantine
Copronymus, for defending the worship of holy
images.&mdash;At Chalons, in France, St. Agricola, bishop.
&mdash;At Nivelle, in Brabant, St. Gertrude, a virgin of
noble birth. Because she despised the world, and
during her whole life practised all kinds of good
works, she deserved to have Christ for her spouse in
heaven.

AT Antioch, the birthday of the martyr St. Phocas,
who triumphed over the old serpent after many
injuries which he suffered for the name of the Redeemer. That triumph is still manifested to the
people in our days; for if any one stung by a serpent,
touches with faith the door of the martyrâ€™s basilica,
the power of the venom disappears, and he is immediately cured.&mdash;At Caesarea, in Palestine, in the persecution of Diocletian, St. Adrian, martyr, who,
being first exposed to a lion for the faith of Christ
and then killed with the sword by order of the governor Firmilian, received the crown of martyrdom.&mdash;
The same day, the passion of the holy martyrs Eusebius, officer of the imperial palace, and nine others.&mdash;
At Caesarea, in Palestine, in the time of the emperor
Severus, St. Theophilus, bishop, who was conspicuous by his wisdom and the purity of his life.&mdash;Also
in Palestine, on the banks of the Jordan, the anchoret St. Gerasimus, who lived in the time of the
emperor Zeno.&mdash;At Naples, the decease of St. John
Joseph of the Cross, Promoter and first Provincial
of the Italian branch of the Order of Discalced
Minorites of St. Peter of Alcantara, who, by emulating the virtues of St. Francis of Assisi and St. Peter
of Alcantara, became a new ornament of the Seraphic Order. He was canonized by pope Gregory
XVI.

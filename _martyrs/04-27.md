AT Nicomedia, during the persecution of Diocletian, the birthday of St. Anthimus, bishop and
martyr, who obtained the glory of martyrdom for
the faith by decapitation. Nearly all his numerous
flock followed him; the judge ordered some to be
beheaded, some to be buried alive, and others to be
put in boats and sunk in the sea.&mdash;At Tarsus, in
Cilicia, the Saints Castor and Stephen, martyrs.&mdash;At Rome, the demise of the blessed pope Anastatius,
a man most rich in his poverty, and filled with apostolic zeal, whom Rome, says St. Jerome, did not deserve to possess long, lest the capital of the world
should be devastated under such a bishop; for
shortly after his death Rome was taken and sacked
by the Goths.&mdash;At Bologna, St. Tertullian, bishop
and.confessor.&mdash;At Brescia, the bishop St. Theophilus.&mdash;At Constantinople, the abbot St. John, who
combated vigorously for the worship of holy images,
under Leo the Isaurian.&mdash;At Tarragona, the blessed
Peter Armengaudius, of the Order of Blessed Mary
of Mercy for the Redemption of Captives, who endured many tribulations in Africa in ransoming the
faithful, and finally closed his career peacefully in
the convent of St. Mary of the Meadows.&mdash;At Lucca
in Italy, blessed Zita, a virgin renowned for virtues
and miracles, whose festival is celebrated on this
day, conformably to the decree of the Sovereign Pontiff Leo X.

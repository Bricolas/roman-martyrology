AT Alexandria, St. Cyril, bishop and doctor of the church. He is mentioned on the 28th of January.&mdash;In the same city, in the reign of Decius, the birthday of St. Apollonia, virgin, who had all her teeth plucked out by the persecutors; then having constructed and lighted a pyre, they threatened to burn her alive, unless she repeated certain impious words after them. Deliberating awhile with herself, she suddenly slipped from their grasp, and feeling an inspiration of the. Holy Ghost, rushed voluntarily into the fire which they had prepared. The very authors of her death were struck with terror at the sight of a woman who was more willing to die than they to condemn her.&mdash;At Rome, the passion of the holy martyrs Alexander, and thirty-eight others crowned with him.&mdash;At Solum, in Cyprus, the holy martyrs Ammonius and Alexander.&mdash;At Antioch, under the emperor Valerian, St. Nicephorus, martyr, who was beheaded and thus received the crown of martyrdom.&mdash;In Africa, in a village called Lemelis, the holy martyrs Primus and Donatus, deacons, who were killed by the Donatists for defending an altar in the church.&mdash;In the monastery of St. Vandrille, St. Ansbert, bishop of Rouen.&mdash;At Canossa, in Apulia, of St. Sabinus, bishop and confessor.
